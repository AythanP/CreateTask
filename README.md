# CreateTask

## A Unity project showcasing a basic, 2D, single player platforming game, using scripts and some animation.

* Collectible coins that are tracked through a current and highscore (Instructor-provided)
* Falling objects with spike sprites (Custom)
* A tilemap to act as the ground (Custom)
