# CreateTask

## A Unity project showcasing a basic, 2D, single player platforming game, using scripts and some animation.

This project is an assignment completed for the Wanic Video Game Programming Year One course. Scripts, sprites, and other assets are a combination of independently made by myself, or provided 
by my instructor. The objects that primarily make up this game and allow it to function include:

* A single player object using a slime-square sprite (Custom and instructor-provided)
* Collectible coins that are tracked through a current and highscore (Instructor-provided)
* Falling objects with spike sprites (Custom)
* A tilemap to act as the ground (Custom)
* Mario-style camera utilizing CinemachineBrain and some scripting (Custom)
